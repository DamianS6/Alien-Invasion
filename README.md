# Alien Invasion - you are the Earth's last chance. How long can you survive?

Alien Invasion is my first bigger project which was created with book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. It was vital for my progress in Python programming not because of learning Pygame but mostly because it was a first project where I needed to combine multiple files and classes to build one working program.

## Usage

To play the game, clone the repository and run alien_invasion.py.

## Technologies:
<ul>
	<li> Python 3.6
	<li> Pygame 1.9.4
</ul>

## Status

For now the project is finished but I hope to develop it further in the future.
